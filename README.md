Description
===========

Wampy.js is javascript library, that runs both in browser and node.js enviroments. It implements [WAMP][] v2 specification on top of
WebSocket object, also provides additional features like autoreconnecting and use of Chaining Pattern.
It has no external dependencies (by default) and is easy to use. Also it's compatible with AMD and browserify.

Wampy.js supports next WAMP roles and features:

* Challenge Response Authentication (wampcra method)
* publisher: advanced profile with features:
    * subscriber blackwhite listing
    * publisher exclusion
    * publisher identification
* subscriber: basic profile
* caller: advanced profile with features:
    * caller identification
    * progressive call results
    * call canceling
    * call timeout
* callee:
    * caller identification

Wampy default serializer is JSON, but it also supports msgpack as serializer.
In that case you need to include msgpack5.js as dependency. See [msgpack5][] for more info.

For WAMP v1 implementation, please see tag v0.1.0.

Usage example
=============

```javascript
var ws = new Wampy('/ws/', { realm: 'AppRealm' });
ws.subscribe('system.monitor.update', function (dataArr, dataObj) { console.log('Received system.monitor.update event!'); })
  .subscribe('client.message', function (dataArr, dataObj) { console.log('Received client.message event!'); })

ws.call('get.server.time', null, {
    onSuccess: function (dataArr, dataObj) {
        console.log('RPC successfully called');
        console.log('Server time is ' + dataArr[0]);
    },
    onError: function (err, detailsObj) {
        console.log('RPC call failed with error ' + err);
    }
});

// Somewhere else for example
ws.publish('system.monitor.update');

ws.publish('client.message', 'Hi guys!');
```

Installation
============

Wampy.js can be installed using bower or npm or just by file-copy :)

```bash
> bower install wampy.js
# Or
> npm install wampy
```

To use Wampy simply add wampy-all.min.js file to your page. It contains msgpack encoder plus wampy itself.

```html
<script src="wampy-all.min.js"></script>
```

In case, you don't plan to use msgpack, just include clean wampy.min.js.

```html
<script src="wampy.min.js"></script>
```

Challenge Response Authentication
=================================

Wampy.js supports challenge response authentication. To use it you need to provide authid and onChallenge callback
as wampy instance options. Also Wampy.js supports "wampcra" authentication method with a little helper
plugin "[wampy-cra][]". Just add "wampy-cra" package and use provided methods as shown below.

```javascript
'use strict';

const Wampy = require('wampy');
const wampyCra = require('wampy-cra');
const w3cws = require('websocket').w3cwebsocket;
let ws;

/**
 * Manual authentication using signed message
 */
ws = new Wampy('ws://wamp.router.url', {
    ws: w3cws,
    realm: 'realm1',
    authid: 'joe',
    authmethods: ['wampcra'],
    onChallenge: (method, info) => {
        console.log('Requested challenge with ', method, info);
        return wampyCra.sign('joe secret key or password', info.challenge);
    },
    onConnect: () => {
        console.log('Connected to Router!');
    }
});

/**
 * Promise-based manual authentication using signed message
 */
ws = new Wampy('ws://wamp.router.url', {
    ws: w3cws,
    realm: 'realm1',
    authid: 'micky',
    authmethods: ['wampcra'],
    onChallenge: (method, info) => {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log('Requested challenge with ', method, info);
                resolve(wampyCra.sign('micky secret key or password', info.challenge));
            }, 2000);
        });
    },
    onConnect: () => {
        console.log('Connected to Router!');
    }
});

/**
 * Manual authentication using salted key and pbkdf2 scheme
 */
ws = new Wampy('ws://wamp.router.url', {
    ws: w3cws,
    realm: 'realm1',
    authid: 'peter',
    authmethods: ['wampcra'],
    onChallenge: (method, info) => {
        const iterations = 100;
        const keylen = 16;
        const salt = 'password salt for user peter';

        console.log('Requested challenge with ', method, info);
        return wampyCra.sign(wampyCra.derive_key('peter secret key or password', salt, iterations, keylen), info.challenge);
    },
    onConnect: () => {
        console.log('Connected to Router!');
    }
});

/**
 * Automatic method detection authentication
 */
ws = new Wampy('ws://wamp.router.url', {
    ws: w3cws,
    realm: 'realm1',
    authid: 'patrik',
    authmethods: ['wampcra'],
    onChallenge: wampyCra.auto('patrik secret key or password'),
    onConnect: () => {
        console.log('Connected to Router!');
    }
});

/**
 * Promise-based automatic method detection authentication
 */
ws = new Wampy('ws://wamp.router.url', {
    ws: w3cws,
    realm: 'realm1',
    authid: 'vanya',
    authmethods: ['wampcra'],
    onChallenge: (method, info) => {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log('Requested challenge with ', method, info);
                resolve(wampyCra.auto('vanya secret key or password')(method, info));
            }, 2000);
        });
    },
    onConnect: () => {
        console.log('Connected to Router!');
    }
});

API
===

Below is a description of exposed public API. Btw, wampy has a type definitions, available at [DefinitelyTyped.org][].

Constructor([url[, options]])
------------------------------------------

Wampy constructor can take 2 parameters:

* **url** to wamp server - optional. If its undefined, page-schema://page-server:page-port/ws will be used.
Can be in forms of:
    * fully qualified url: schema://server:port/path
    * server:port/path. In this case page schema will be used.
    * /path. In this case page schema, server, port will be used.
* **options** hash-table. The only required field is `realm`. For node.js enviroment also necessary to
specify `ws` - websocket module. See description below.

```javascript
// in browser
ws = new Wampy();
ws = new Wampy('/my-socket-path');
ws = new Wampy('ws://socket.server.com:5000/ws', { autoReconnect: false });
ws = new Wampy({ reconnectInterval: 1*1000 });

// in node.js
w3cws = require('websocket').w3cwebsocket;
ws = new Wampy(null, { ws: w3cws });
ws = new Wampy('/my-socket-path', { ws: w3cws });
ws = new Wampy('ws://socket.server.com:5000/ws', { autoReconnect: false, ws: w3cws });
ws = new Wampy({ reconnectInterval: 1*1000, ws: w3cws });

```

Json serializer will be used by default. If you want to use msgpack encoder, pass it through options,
and set encoding type to 'msgpack'.

```javascript
// in browser
ws = new Wampy('ws://socket.server.com:5000/ws', {
    transportEncoding: 'msgpack',
    msgpackCoder: msgpack5
});
ws = new Wampy({
    transportEncoding: 'msgpack',
    msgpackCoder: msgpack5
});

// in node.js
w3cws = require('websocket').w3cwebsocket;
msgpack = require('msgpack5')();
ws = new Wampy('ws://socket.server.com:5000/ws', {
    ws: w3cws,
    transportEncoding: 'msgpack',
    msgpackCoder: msgpack
});
ws = new Wampy({
    ws: w3cws,
    transportEncoding: 'msgpack',
    msgpackCoder: msgpack
});

```

options([opts])
---------------

.options() method can be called in two forms:

* without parameters it will return current options
* with one parameter as hash-table it will set new options. Support chaining.

Options attributes description:

* **strictURIValidation**. Default value: true. Allows relaxed/loose when is disable.
* **debug**. Default value: false. Enable debugging with console log.
* **autoReconnect**. Default value: true. Enable autoreconnecting. In case of connection failure, Wampy will
try to reconnect to WAMP server, and if you were subscribed to any topics,
or had registered some procedures, Wampy will resubscribe to that topics and reregister procedures.
* **reconnectInterval**. Default value: 2000 (ms). Reconnection Interval in ms.
* **maxRetries**. Default value: 25. Max reconnection attempts. After reaching this value [.disconnect()](#disconnect)
will be called
* **transportEncoding**. Default value: json. Transport serializer to use. Supports 2 values: json|msgpack.
For using msgpack you need to provide [msgpack5][] javascript library, set up **msgpackCoder** option, and wamp server,
that also supports it.
* **realm**. Default value: null. WAMP Realm to join on server. See WAMP spec for additional info.
* **helloCustomDetails**. Default value: null. Custom attributes to send to router on hello.
* **authid**. Default value: null. Authentication (user) id to use in challenge.
* **authmethods**. Default value: []. Array of strings of supported authentication methods.
* **onChallenge**. Default value: null. Callback function.
Is fired when wamp server requests authentication during session establishment.
This function receives two arguments: auth method and challenge details.
Function should return computed signature, based on challenge details.
See [Challenge Response Authentication](#challenge-response-authentication) section and [WAMP Spec CRA][] for more info.
* **onConnect**. Default value: null. Callback function. Fired when connection to wamp server is established.
* **onClose**. Default value: null. Callback function. Fired on closing connection to wamp server.
* **onError**. Default value: null. Callback function. Fired on error in websocket communication.
* **onReconnect**. Default value: null. Callback function. Fired every time on reconnection attempt.
* **onReconnectSuccess**. Default value: null. Callback function. Fired every time when reconnection succeeded.
* **ws**. Default value: null. User provided WebSocket class. Useful in node enviroment.
* **msgpackCoder**. Default value: null. User provided msgpack class. Useful if you plan to use msgpack encoder
instead of default json. Theoretically, any msgpack encoder with encode/decode methods should work.
In practice, [msgpack5][] tested and works well with [Wiola][], [msgpack-lite](https://github.com/kawanet/msgpack-lite)
doesn't work as expected. Feel free to research other variants.

```javascript
ws.options();

ws.options({
    reconnectInterval: 1000,
    maxRetries: 999,
    onConnect: function () { console.log('Yahoo! We are online!'); },
    onClose: function () { console.log('See you next time!'); },
    onError: function () { console.log('Breakdown happened'); },
    onReconnect: function () { console.log('Reconnecting...'); },
    onReconnectSuccess: function () { console.log('Reconnection succeeded...'); }
});
```

getOpStatus()
---------------

Returns the status of last operation. Wampy is developed in a such way, that every operation returns **this** even
in case of error to suport chaining. But if you want to know status of last operation, you can call .getOpStatus().
This method returns an object with 2 or 3 attributes: code and description and possible request ID .
Code is integer, and value > 0 means error.
Description is a description of code.
Request ID is integer and may be useful in some cases (call canceling for example).

```javascript
ws.publish('system.monitor.update');
ws.getOpStatus();
// may return { code: 1, description: "Topic URI doesn't meet requirements!" }
// or { code: 2, description: "Server doesn't provide broker role!" }
// or { code: 0, description: "Success!", reqId: 1565723572 }
```

register(topicURI, callbacks)
-----------------------------------------------

RPC registration for invocation. Supports chaining.

Parameters:

* **topicURI**. Required. A string that identifies the remote procedure to be called.
Must meet a WAMP Spec URI requirements.
* **callbacks**. Required. If it is a function - it will be treated as rpc itself
             or it can be hash table of callbacks:

           { rpc: registered procedure
             onSuccess: will be called on successful registration
             onError: will be called if registration would be aborted }

Registered PRC during invocation will receive two arguments: payload (may be null), and options object. One attribute
of interest in options is "receive_progress" (boolean), which indicates, that caller is willing to receive progressive
results, if possible. RPC can return no result (undefined), or it must return an array with 2 elements:

* \[0\] element must contain options object or {} if not needed. Possible attribute of options is "progress": true, which
indicates, that it's a progressive result, so there will be more results in future. Be sure to unset "progress"
on last result message.
* \[1\] element can contain result, which can be a simple value, array or object

```javascript
var sqrt_f = function (x) { return [{}, x*x]; };

ws.register('sqrt.value', sqrt_f);

ws.register('sqrt.value', {
    rpc: sqrt_f,
    onSuccess: function (data) {
        console.log('RPC successfully registered');
    },
    onError: function (err, details) {
        console.log('RPC registration failed!',err);
    }
});
```

Also wampy supports rpc with asynchronous code, such as some user interactions or xhr, using promises.
For using this functionality in old browsers you should use polyfills,
like [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise). Check brower support
at [can i use](http://caniuse.com/#search=promise) site.

```javascript
var getUserName = function () {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        /* Ask user to input his username somehow,
           and resolve promise with user input at the end */
        resolve([{}, userInput]);
    });
};

ws.register('get.user.name', getUserName);
```

* **callbacks**. Optional. If it is a function - it will be called on successful unregistration
             or it can be hash table of callbacks:

           { onSuccess: will be called on successful unregistration
             onError: will be called if unregistration would be aborted }

```javascript

Quick comparison to other libs
==============================

| Topic         | Wampy.js | AutobahnJS  |
|-------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Runs on | browser | browser and NodeJS |
| Dependencies | msgpack5.js (optional) | when.js, CryptoJS (optional) |
| Creating connection | var connection = new Wampy('ws://127.0.0.1:9000/', { realm: 'realm1' }); | var connection = new autobahn.Connection({url: 'ws://127.0.0.1:9000/', realm: 'realm1'}); |
| Opening a connection | connection opens on creating an instance, or can be opened by: connection.connect() | connection.open(); |
| Connection Callbacks | Wampy supports next callbacks: onConnect, onClose, onError, onReconnect. Callbacks can be specified via options object passed to constructor, or via .options() method. | AutobahnJS provides two callbacks: connection.onopen = function (session) { } and connection.onclose = function (reason/string, details/dict) { } |
| WAMP API methods with parameters | While using Wampy you don't have to explicitly specify the payload type (single value, array, object), just pass it to api method. <br/>For example:<br/>ws.publish('chat.message.received', 'user message');<br/>ws.publish('chat.message.received', ['user message1', 'user message2']);<br/>ws.publish('chat.message.received', { message: 'user message'});<br/>Also Wampy is clever enough to understand some specific options, for example, if you specify a success or error callback to publish method, Wampy will automatically set acknowledge flag to true.  | In AutobahnJS you need to use only arrays and objects, as it's specified in WAMP, and also choose right argument position.<br/>For example:<br/>session.publish('com.myapp.hello', ['Hello, world!']);<br/>session.publish('com.myapp.hello', [], {message: 'Hello, world!'});<br/>Also you need to explicitly provide additional options, like {acknowledge: true} |
| Method callbacks | Most of the API methods take a **callbacks** parameter, which is hash-table of posible callbacks | AutobahnJS make use of **Deffered** object, and most of API methods return a deferred object, so you can specify callbacks using .then() method |
| Chaining support | Wampy supports methods chaining.<br/>connection.subscribe(...).publish(...).call(...) |  |
| Transport encoders | json, msgpack (optional) | json |

Which one library to use - choice is yours!

Tests and code coverage
=======================

Wampy.js uses mocha and chai for tests and istanbul for code coverage. You can run both from cli

```bash
# run tests with mocha (use your own favorite reporter)
> mocha -R spec
# or use standart npm test command
> npm test

# for code coverage report run
> npm run-script cover
# and then open coverage/lcov-report/index.html

```
